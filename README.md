# Bikesharing
An analysis of CitiBike in New York City for August 2019 using Tableau.

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City in order to present it to potential investors for a new bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. Although, Des Moines may have some differences from New York City, this analysis might help answer some important questions:

  *Who uses bikeshare programs?
  *What area of a city has the most bikeshare usage?
  *What time of day are bikes used the most or the least?
  *How often are the bikes used and by who?

As our visualizations show above we can see that more than 75% of users are subscribers who use bikes frequently. These subcribers provide a reliable and steady income stream for the company. Riders are also predominantly verified as male compared to female riders or those genders which are unknown.

The above charts indicate that the most popular ride times are from 7-9 AM and 5-7PM. Weekend ride times are more popular during the day with larger hours from 10AM-7PM.
When factoring gender it is again reinforced that riders are typically male. More studies could be done to understand the reasoning behind gender differences.
